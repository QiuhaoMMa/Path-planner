# Path-planner

This repository provides the official MATLAB implementation and datasets used in the paper **"A Standard Framework for Testing and Benchmarking of 2D RRT Path Planner"**. It offers a unified simulation environment for systematically testing and comparing multiple sampling-based path-planning algorithms across diverse 2D scenarios. The framework is intended for benchmarking, analysis, and educational use in robotics and motion planning research.

## üìå Features

- **Implemented Algorithms**
  - RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree)
  - RRT* (Optimal RRT with rewiring)
  - Informed RRT* (Goal-biased sampling)
  - RRT*-Smart (RRT* with local path refinement)
  - LazyRRT (Lazy collision checking)

- **Benchmark Scenarios**
  - Macro Obstacles
  - Micro Obstacles
  - Multi-Obstacle Indoor
  - Indoor Room
  - Circular Maze
  - Serpentine Corridor
  - Narrow Path Corridor
  - Narrow Gate Passage
  - Branching Pathways
  - Enclosed Starting
  - Enclosed Goal

Each scenario has three levels of difficulty: Easy, Modest, and Difficult, to test algorithm performance under increasing complexity.
